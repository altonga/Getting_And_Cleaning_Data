# Getting_And_Cleaning_Data

This is the repo for the course project.

* Data is obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

* Unzipping should produce  a folder called UCI HAR Dataset. This folder contains test and train folders and activity_labels.txt, features_info.txt, and features.txt.

* Call this folder $PROJECT. Then place run_analysis.R in $PROJECT and run the script.

* This should produce data_with_averages_per_student_activity.txt, which is the desired output file.
